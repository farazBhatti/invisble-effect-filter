step 1
-downloaded individual deep lab folder from git



step 2 Installation of dependencies
My machine was already configured so i didnt had to install dependencies ,but for the task following are steps:
-pip3 install tensorflow == 1.5
-pip3 install numpy
-pip3 install jupyter 
-pip3 install matplotlib
-pip3 install pil


step 3 



Task 1
Segment out given images

Solution:
-images from url can also be segmented out 
-changed a code a little so that images stored in file(root folder)
can also be used for application of segmentation
-downloaded two images from email and stored in the root directory

Task 2
apply segmentation to the given video

errors whil coding
-video frame has to be converted to image(jpg) as MODEL.run() takes jpg image instead of array 



Task 3 
Application of preproccessing on images and video
I have applied bluring and sharpening of images.
Although results of preprocessing might not be visible but through experimentation during my thesis 
I am confidenet that sharpeing of images/frame does give slightly better segmentation result.


Complete code is being shared via .ipynb.
